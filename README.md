**PROJECT DESCRIPTION:**

The income or expense and the description will be saved per individual session or until the user clears the calculator and can be accessed via the "List Incomes" or "List Expenses" Button. Once the "Calculate" button has been pressed
the budgets will be displayed.

**PROJECT FEATURES/HOW TO:**
To use this form simply put in your decimal value into the "Budget Input" box. Optionally you can add a Description of this value in the "Description" Box.
Choose if this input is an income, expense, or reoccuring using the buttons under "Budget Settings" to the right of the boxes.
Once you have done the above simply press the "Add Input" button to add your income or expense to the calculator, if you lose track of what you just put in the "Last Input" boxes will display what you just put in.

After you are done inputting all of your incomes and expenses simply click the "Calculate" to receive your Income Subtotal, Expense Subtotal, Monthly Budget, and Annual Budget.
